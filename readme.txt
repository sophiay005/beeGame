Project Description:
My term project is called the Bee Project. The player controls a bee with animated flapping wings, which follows the gradual movement of the mouse cursor. 
The objective is to gather pollen from drifting flowers, each with its unique color, by moving the mouse (bee) to make contact; 
then pollinating a different flower with the same color. With the addition of helper bees, the gameplay is more collaborative and dynamic. 

How to Run the Project: 
Download the TP3 zip file. Open the main.py file. 
No particular libraries are needed other than cmu_graphics. 
No shortcut commands and special fonts.
